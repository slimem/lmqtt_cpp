# lmqtt_cpp_wip (Work In Progress)
A header-only mqtt server written in **c++17** and based on **non-boost asio**.

My main objective is to write a **lightweight**, **scalable** and **high performace** mqtt server with no other libraries than **stl** and **asio**.
This server will be used in the iot-based projects that I'm working on.
